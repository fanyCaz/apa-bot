# apa-bot
Bot that gets the APA reference of any book ... as long as it is available in this page: https://openlibrary.org/developers/api.

Now I want to include movies too... as long as they're available in this page: https://imdb-api.com/api

## How to : local
1. Get in folder source: ```cd apa-bot```
2. Install dependencies: ```yarn install```
3. Tell the bot to get something done: ```yarn dev``` in a console window to bring it to life.
4. ```yarn watch``` in a different console window to watch errors while you code.

*Optional* : You can just run ```yarn coding``` in a single console and it will fire both yarn events. 

*Also* : I've set up the ```yarn start``` command to only fire the execution of the js code. Feel free to watch the commands in the ```package.json``` file.

### Also
This is the first time using Node, TypeScript and Javascript(without wanting to end it all), so, this is as good as it gets.

Edit:\
So I think its cleaner now, but we'll see
