# apa-bot
Bot that gets the APA reference of any book ... as long as it is available in this page: https://openlibrary.org/developers/api.
Now I want to include movies too... as long as they're available in this page: https://imdb-api.com/api

## How to : local
1. Get in folder source: ```cd src```
2. Make the TypeScript file in a JavaScript file: ```npx tsc bot.ts```
3. Tell the bot to get something done: ```node bot.js```

### Also
This is the first time using Node, TypeScript and Javascript(without wanting to end it all), so, this is as good as it gets.
