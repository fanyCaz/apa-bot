# apa-bot
Bot that gets the APA reference of any book ... as long as it is available in this page: https://openlibrary.org/developers/api.
Now I want to include movies too... as long as they're available in this page: https://imdb-api.com/api

## How to : local
1. Get in folder source: ```cd apa-bot```
2. Install dependencies: ```npm install```
3. Tell the bot to get something done: ```yarn dev```
or ```yarn watch```

### Also
This is the first time using Node, TypeScript and Javascript(without wanting to end it all), so, this is as good as it gets.

Edit:
So I think its cleaner now, but we'll see
